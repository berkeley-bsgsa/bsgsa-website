# Berkeley BSGSA Website

This site uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/).

After [installing Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/), run `quarto
preview` from the root directory, which will open the site locally in your
default browser.

Any changes you make while `quarto preview` is running will automatically update
the local preview.

When you're happy with the changes, commit and push them. This will trigger a
GitHub Actions workflow that updates the live site with your changes.
